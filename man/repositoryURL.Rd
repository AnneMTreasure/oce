\title{Calculate a web link to download Oceanographic data}
\usage{
repositoryURL(item, id, window, domain, subdomain)
}
\arguments{
\item{item}{A string indicating the item sought; see \dQuote{Details}.}

\item{id}{A string indicating the ID of the sought item.}

\item{window}{A list specifying a data window for a snapshot; the contents are
\code{ocean}, a string naming the ocean (must be \code{"Atlantic"},
\code{"Pacific"} or \code{"Indian"}) and a string named \code{time},
specifying a date in the format \code{yyyymmdd}.}

\item{domain}{The base-level domain (more information to be added later).}

\item{subdomain}{The second-level domain (more information to be added later).}
}
\description{
This function is able to construct universal resource identifiers (URIs)
that can be used with \code{\link{download.file}} to download data from
several common Oceanographic repositories.   The goal of this function is to
spare users the task of finding such URLs for casual use or one-off
applications.  There is no intention of trying  to reproduce the web tools
provided with many repositories, nor to provide an exhaustive interface to
a wide suite of data types (see \dQuote{Contributing}).
}
\details{
The following values for \code{item} are handled.

\strong{argo} data. These may be looked up by float number or 
by ocean/day window.\enumerate{
\item \emph{Per-float mode.} The return value is constructed
as \code{[domain]/pub/outgoing/argo/dac/[subdomain]/[id]/[id]_prof.nc},
where square brackets indicate the values of the named arguments
to \code{repositoryURL}. This has only been checked for domain
\code{domain="ftp://usgodae.org"} and \code{subdomain="bodc"},
so these are the defaults. The value of the relevant subdomain may
be known to users familiar with argo data; others can discover the
data archiving center for a given float by inspecting the subdirectories
of the FTP site \code{ftp://usgodae.org/pub/outgoing/argo/dac}
or by accessing
\code{ftp://usgodae.org/pub/outgoing/argo/ar_index_global_meta.txt}
and searching for the float identifer.
\item \emph{Per-ocean/day mode.}  See example 2.
}
Caution: tests made in January 2016 revealed that 
\code{http://data.nodc.noaa.gov} stores argo files with
\emph{lower-case} names, which is inconsistent
with argo documentation [1] and incompatible with \code{\link{read.argo}}.

\section{History}{

This function was drafted in late January, 2016, and its argument
list is likely to change through the early months of 2016. Some
of this will be to accommodate new data types, but changes to 
website structures will also precipitate changes to how this
function works.
}

\section{Contributing}{

This function will be most useful if users contribute to it, both by 
pointing out changes to URLs and by suggesting additions for useful
datasets. The most useful comments will be concrete; merely suggesting
that an interface be provided to such-and-such server is too vague
to help much.

1. The \code{argo} netCDF format is described at

as of January 28, 2016, Section 2.2.4 of this document
indicates that variable names are to be in upper case,
which is true for the \code{nodc.noaa.gov} server, so data provided
by this server cannot be read with \code{\link{read.argo}}.
