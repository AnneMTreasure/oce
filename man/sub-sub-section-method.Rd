\title{Extract Something From a section Object}
\usage{
\S4method{[[}{section}(x, i, j, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A section object, i.e. one inheriting from \code{\link{section-class}}.}

\item{i}{Character string indicating the name of item to extract.}

\item{j}{Optional additional information on the \code{i} item.}

\item{...}{Optional additional information (ignored).}
}
\description{
The \code{[[} notation works for all \code{oce} objects. It looks up
information in a two-step process. First, a class-specific function 
is used to try to access the requested information (see
\dQuote{Details of the specialized ... method}). Then, if no match is found, a
general function is used (see \sQuote{Details of the general
method}). If neither method can handle the requested item,
then \code{NULL} is returned.
}
\section{Details of the specialized section method}{

If \code{i} is the string \code{"station"}, then the method 
will return a \code{\link{list}} of 
\code{\link{ctd-class}} objects holding the station data. If \code{j} 
is also given and is an integer, then just the j-th station in the section is returned.

If \code{i} is \code{"station ID"}, then the IDs of the stations in the 
section are returned.

If \code{i} is \code{"dynamic height"}, then an estimate of dynamic
height is returned (as calculated with \code{\link{swDynamicHeight}(x)}).

If \code{i} is \code{"distance"}, then the distance along the section is
returned, using \code{\link{geodDist}}.

If \code{i} is \code{"depth"}, then a vector containing the depths
of the stations is returned.

If none of the conditions listed above holds, the general
method is used (see \sQuote{Details of the general method}).
}

\section{Details of the general method}{


If the specialized method produces no matches, the following generalized
method is applied. As with the specialized method, the procedure hinges
first on the value of \code{i}.

First, a check is made as to whether \code{i} names one of the standard
\code{oce} slots, and returns the slot contents if so. Thus, 
\code{x[["metadata"]]} will retrieve the \code{metadata} slot, 
while \code{x[["data"]]} and \code{x[["processingLog"]]} return
those slots.

Next, if \code{i} is a string ending in the
\code{"Unit"}, then the characters preceding that string
are taken to be the name of an item in the data object, and a list
containing the unit is returned. This list consists of an item
named \code{unit}, which is an \code{\link{expression}}, and
an item named \code{scale}, which is a string describing the
measurement scale.  If the string ends in \code{" unit"}, e.g.
\code{x[["temperature unit"]]}, then just the expression is returned, 
and if it ends in \code{" scale"}, then just the scale is returned.

Next, if \code{i} is a string ending in \code{"Flag"}, then the corresponding
data-quality flag is returned (or \code{NULL} if there is no such flag). 
For example, \code{x[["salinityFlag"]]} returns a vector of salinity
flags if \code{x} is a ctd object.

If none of the preceding conditions are met, a check is done
to see if the \code{metadata} slot contains an item with
the provided name, and that is returned, if so. A direct match
is required for this condition.

Finally, the \code{data} slot is checked to see if it contains 
an item with the name indicated by \code{i}. In this case, a partial
match will work; this is accomplished by using \code{\link{pmatch}}.

If none of the above-listed conditions holds, then \code{NULL} is returned.
