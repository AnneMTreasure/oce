The Oce vignette provides a good starting point.  To get it, install Oce and
then type `vignette("oce")` in an R console.

Dan Kelley and Clark Richards are preparing to write a paper about the use
of Oce, although the journal has not yet been selected.  A natural journal for
    an in-depth exposition might be <a
        href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-geosciences/">Computers
        and Geosciences</a>.  The AGU EOS Transactions and the <a
    href="http://www.cmos.ca/site/cmos_bulletin">CMOS Bulletin</a> both seem
like good choices for briefer introductions.

Dan Kelley's [blog](http://dankelley.github.io/blog) has many items relating to
Oce.  His upcoming textbook, entitled *Oceanographic Analysis with R*, deals
extensively with Oce.  A provisional table of contents of that book is given
below.
