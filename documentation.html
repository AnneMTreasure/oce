<p>The Oce vignette provides a good starting point.  To get it, install Oce and
then type <tt>vignette("oce")</tt> in an R console.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley and Clark Richards are preparing to write a paper about the use
of Oce, although the journal has not yet been selected.  A natural journal for
    an in-depth exposition might be <a
        href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-geosciences/">Computers
        and Geosciences</a>.  The AGU EOS Transactions and the <a
    href="http://www.cmos.ca/site/cmos_bulletin">CMOS Bulletin</a> both seem
like good choices for briefer introductions.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley's <a href="http://dankelley.github.io/blog/">blog</a> has many
items relating to Oce.  His upcoming textbook, entitled <i>Oceanographic
Analysis with R</i>, deals extensively with Oce.  A provisional table of
contents of that book is given below.</p>
