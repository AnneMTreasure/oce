<p>The Oce vignette provides a good starting point.  To get it, install Oce and
then type <tt>vignette("oce")</tt> in an R console.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley and Clark Richards are preparing to write a paper about the use
of Oce, although the journal has not yet been selected.  The AGU EOS
Transactions and the CMOS Bulletin both seem like good choices but both require
subscriptions, which defeats the purpose of reaching a wide audience.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley's <a href="http://dankelley.github.io/blog/">blog</a> has many
items relating to Oce.  His upcoming textbook, entitled <i>Oceanographic
Analysis with R</i>, deals extensively with Oce.  A provisional table of
contents of that book is given below.</p>
