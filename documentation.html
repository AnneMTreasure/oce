<p>The Oce vignette provides a good starting point.  To get it, install Oce and
then type</p> <code>vignette("oce")</code> in an R console.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley and Clark Richards are preparing to write a paper about the use
of Oce, although the journal has not yet been selected.  The AGU EOS
Transactions and the CMOS Bulletin both seem like good choices but both require
subscriptions, which defeats the purpose of reaching a wide oceanographic
community.</p>

<p>Dan Kelley's <a href="http://dankelley.github.io/blog/">blog</a> has many
items relating to Oce.</p>

<p>Oce is a key topic in Dan's upcoming textbook, entitled <i>Oceanographic
    Analysis with R</i>, with provisional table of contents as below.</p>
