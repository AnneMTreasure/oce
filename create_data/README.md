# Instructions

1. All datasets should be created here. 
2. Subdirectories should be named to match those datasets.
3. Copy an existing `Makefile` to newly-added directories, changing the first line as appropriate.
4. Add any new dataset to the various `check*.R` files found here. These check things like
  a. `check_units.R` -- ensure the existence of `units` within `metadata` (becomes moot once it works, late 2015)
  b. `check_summary.R` -- checks that `summary()` works on all datasets
  c. `check_plot.R` -- check that `plot()` works on all datasets
