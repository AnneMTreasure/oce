Description: Supports the analysis of Oceanographic data, including ADCP
 measurements, CTD measurements, sectional data, sea-level time series,
 coastline files, etc.  Handles dozens of specialized functions for calculating
 seawater properties such as potential temperature and density, as well as
 derived properties such as buoyancy frequency and dynamic height. Map projections
 are calculated using the rgdal package, so it must be installed if mapPlot() is used.
