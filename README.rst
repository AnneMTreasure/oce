``Oce`` is an R package for processing oceanographic data.  Stable
versions of the package are normally installed via R itself.  This
repository is for developers and users who wish to report bugs or
suggest features.  Prior to March 2010, ``oce`` was hosted on google,
but that site lacked git, so a move was in order.
