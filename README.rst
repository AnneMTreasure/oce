``Oce`` is an R package for processing oceanographic data.  Stable
versions of the package are normally installed with R itself.  This
repository is for developers and users who wish to report bugs or
suggest features.  There are two branches of interest: a relatively
stable branch named ``master`` and the development branch named
``develop``.  These may be thought of as beta and alpha pre-release
versions of Oce.  To use the develop branch, you must first set up to
"track" it, by doing as follows

    git checkout --track origin/develop

This only has to be done *one time*.  After this is done, you may do

     git checkout develop

to switch to the ``develop`` branch and then do

     git pull

to pull the updates.  (If you stay on the develop branch, you will
just need to do this final step, to get updates.)
