``Oce`` is an R package for processing oceanographic data.  Stable
versions of the package are normally installed via R itself.  This
repository is for developers and users who wish to report bugs or
suggest features.  There are two branches of interest: a relatively
stable branch named ``master`` and the development branch named
``develop``.  These may be thought of as beta and alpha pre-release
versions of Oce.  To use the develop branch, you must first set up to
"track" it, by doing as follows

    git checkout --track origin/develop

and, after that, you should be able to just do 

     git checkout develop
     git pull

to get updates.
