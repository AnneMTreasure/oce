``Oce`` is an R package for processing oceanographic data.  Stable
versions of the package are normally installed via R itself.  This
repository is for developers and users who wish to report bugs or
suggest features.  The first step, after cloning, is to do

    git branch --track develop origin/develop

to track the ``develop`` branch, as well as the default ``master``
branch.  The former is used for testing (e.g. may not even build),
while the latter is somewhat more stable (e.g. should build).
