<p>A simple way to report a bug is to email a report to <a
    href="mailto:dan.kelley@dal.ca">Dan Kelley@Dal.Ca</a>.  However, people who
are comfortable with web interfaces are highly encouraged to instead use the
Oce <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues">development site</a> to
report bugs, because that makes it much easier to track the bug fix.  The
development site also lists previous bug reports, so it can be a good place to
look to see if your bug has already been reported.  </p>

<p>The best issues are granular (one issue report per problem), and are stated
with a subject line that is short and clear.  This granularity and clarity
yields two benefits.  First, it means that other users can easily scan issue
titles to see if an issue has already been reported.  Second, it means that the
developer can address issues in isolation, which generally leads to more
reliable results.  Sometimes the developer will edit issue reports (especially
titles) to improve clarity, or suggest that a new comment should be the basis
for a new issue.</p>

<p>The interchange of comments on issues can be carried out with the web
interface or with an email interface.  In the latter case, reporters are
cautioned to avoid letting their email program auto-include signature lines
with phone numbers, etc.  This is a privacy concern.  Generally, the developer
will notice that, and edit the comment.</p>

<p>In any case, it is helpful if issues contain (a) test code that demonstrates
the problem but does very little else, (b) a statement of the expected result,
(c) a statement of the actual result, (d) the output from the R command
<code>sessionInfo()</code>.  Data files can be sent directly to Dan, who 
can keep them secret if desired by the reporter.</p>
