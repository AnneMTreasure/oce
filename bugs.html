<p>A simple way to report a bug is to email a report to <a
    href="mailto:dan.kelley@dal.ca">Dan Kelley@Dal.Ca</a>.  However, people who
are comfortable with web interfaces are highly encouraged to instead use the
Oce <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues">development site</a> to
report bugs, because that makes it much easier to track the bug fix.  The
development site also lists previous bug reports, so it can be a good place to
look to see if your bug has already been reported.  The list provided below might help users who
are considering reporting bugs, or asking for new features.</p>

<enumerate>

<item><emph>What is an issue?</emph><p>An issue can be a bug report or a
suggestion for an enhancement. Since the latter is quite straightforward, the
following items apply mainly to bug reports.</p>
  
<item> <emph>When to report a bug.</emph> <p>Since your report can help other
users, it makes sense to submit it as soon as you have isolated and can
describe the problem. Don't be shy. Once you've read the rest of this list, you
should know how to frame your report.</p>

<item><emph>How to title a bug report.</emph> <p>A good title is specific,
informative and brief. Users should be able to scan titles to see if something
they are experiencing has already been reported. Imagine yourself scanning the
titles of dozens of issues.  Specific titles will be more useful to you than
vague ones; "plotting problem" tells you almost nothing, while
"<code>plotTS()</code> isopcynals are misplaced" is probably enough to tell you
if you should investigate that report in more detail. Resist the urge to put
multiple issues in one report.</p>

<item> <emph>What to include within an issue report.</emph> <p>It is helpful if
bug reports contain (a) test code that demonstrates the problem but does very
little else, (b) a statement of the expected result, (c) a statement of the
actual result, (d) the output from the R command <code>sessionInfo()</code>.</p>

<item><emph>How can data files be connected to issues?</emph> <p>First,
consider whether you can demonstrate your bug without using a data file. Please
see whether one of the built-in datasets (in <code>oce</code> or
<code>ocedata</code>) can be used; that way, other users can reproduce your
problem, and may be able to help. If that fails, you may put your data onto
Dropbox or some similar site. Quite often, though, the datasets are private,
and in that case, please send a private email to Dan, who can assure that your
data remain private.</p>

<item> <emph>When to close an issue.</emph> <p>Issues should be closed when the
matter, as described in the title, has been addressed. To return to the
<code>plotTS()</code> example, the issue would be closed when the isopycnal
line placement is rectified. (See the next item, regarding tangential issues.)
By convention, the reporter should close the issue, not the developers.
However, sometimes the developers will close an issue if they feel that a
solution has been provided, and if the reporter has ignored requests to comment
upon or close the issue over a significant time interval.</p>

<item> <emph>When to open a new (related) issue.</emph><p>From the above, an
astute reader will realize that a new issue should be reported whenever it
occurs, and that can mean during the discussion of an existing issue. It is
important to avoid issue bloat. If problem Y becomes apparent during the
discussion of problem X, then it should be reported in a new issue. In deciding
whether to create a new issue, just ask whether another user would come upon Y
if they were searching through five hundred titles, including one mentioning
X.</p>
