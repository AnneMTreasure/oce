<p>The simplest way to report a bug is to emailing a report to <a
    href="mailto:dan.kelley@dal.ca">Dan Kelley@Dal.Ca</a>.  However, people who
are comfortable with web interfaces should instead use the Oce <a
    href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues">development site</a> to
report bugs, because that makes it much easier to track the bug fix.  The
development site also lists previous bug reports, so it can be a good place to
look to see if your bug has already been reported.  </p>

<p>In any case, it is helpful if issues contain (a) test code that demonstrates
the problem but does very little else, (b) a statement of the expected result,
(c) a statement of the actual result, (d) the output from the R command
<code>sessionInfo()</code>.  Data files can be sent directly to Dan, who 
can keep them secret if desired by the reporter.</p>
