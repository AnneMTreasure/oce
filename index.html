<p>Oce is a package for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R statistical
    language</a> that helps Oceanographers do their work by providing functions
to read Oceanographic data files, to process the data in instrument-specific
ways, and to represent the results with plots that follow Oceanographic
convention.</p>

<p>Developed in a university and research setting, Oce is simple enough for
novices but powerful enough for experts.</p>

<p>Oce makes heavy use of the R notion of <i>generic functions</i>, which means
that a single function call works across a wide range of data types.  For example,</p>
```R
library(oce)
d <- read.oce("file")
plot(d)
```
<p>will produce a useful plot that is tailored to the type of data stored in
the file named <code>file</code>.  For example, if <code>file</code> contains
CTD data, then the <code>read.oce()</code> function will return an object of
class <code>ctd</code>, causing <code>plot()</code> to produce profiles of
salinity, temperature, density and buoyancy frequency, along with a TS plot and
a location map.  But if <code>file</code> contains ADCP data, the results will
instead be a set of images giving space-time variation of velocity components.
Similar behaviours result from the dozens of data types recognized by Oce.</p>

<p>Installing Oce is a simple matter, as shown in the next tab of this website.
Other tabs provide entries into the documentation and the bug-reporting
system.</p>
