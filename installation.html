<h1>The stable version</h1>

<p>The stable version of oce is provided on the R archives.  It is installed
from within R with
{% highlight R %}
install.packages("oce")
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<h1>Pre-compiled development version (for casual users)</h1>

<p>About once per week, <code>oce</code> is compiled for MSWindows and for OS X. The results are stored 
at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/awlz31v1jj7w0ct/620Tf2ZkGz">a Dropbox
    site</a>. Visit that site and the appropriate subdirectory (<code>osx</code> or <code>windows</code>), and download both <code>oce</code> and <code>ocedata</code>. Then install as, for example on OS X,
{% highlight %}
R CMD install oce_0.9-18.tgz 
R CMD install ocedata_0.1.4.tgz 
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<h1>Source code for the development version (for advanced users)</h1>

<p>Users who are set up to build packages (which requires a C compiler, etc; see note 1) may stay at the cutting edge by installing a development version.  This may be done in several ways, of which the third is probably the best for most users.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Download the source for oce and ocedata as tarballs
    (<a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/tarball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/tarball/master">ocedata</a>),
    expand the files, rename the resultant directories to <code>oce</code>
    and <code>ocedata</code> and then execute the OS commands stated below.
{% highlight bash %}
R CMD build oce
R CMD install oce_0.9-18.tar.gz # adjust version as needed
R CMD build ocedata
R CMD install ocedata_0.1.4.gz  # adjust version as needed
{% endhighlight %}
A similar procedure works for the zip files at 
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/zipball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/zipball/master">ocedata</a>.
   <li> Acquire the sources through Git using
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/oce.git
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/ocedata.git
{% endhighlight %}
    and then build them as described in #1.
    <li> Download and build using <code>install_github()</code>
{% highlight R %}
library(devtools)
install_github("dankelley/oce", ref="develop")
install_github("dankelley/ocedata", ref="master")
{% endhighlight %}
</ol>

<p><b>Note 1.</b> Getting ready to compile (by installing the gcc compiler,
etc.) is easy on linux, although the method depends on the system. On
MSWindows, install <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">
Rtools from CRAN</a>.  OSX instructions are provided at <a
                      href="http://r.research.att.com/tools/">the ATT site</a>
... although it is possible that RStudio comes with the requisite tools, so you
might want to try that first.</p>
