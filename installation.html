<p>The stable version of oce is provided on the R archives.  It is installed from within R, just like other packages.</p>

<p>Users who are set up to build packages (which requires a C compiler, etc) may stay at the cutting edge by installing a development version.  This may be done in several ways.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Download the source for oce and ocedata as tarballs (
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/tarball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/tarball/master">ocedata</a>),
    or as zip files
    (<a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/zipball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/zipball/master">ocedata</a>),
    and then build both with the following OS commands
{% highlight bash %}
R CMD build oce
R CMD install oce_0.9-15.tar.gz
R CMD build ocedata_0.1.1.gz
R CMD install ocedata_0.1.1.gz
{% endhighlight %}
(where similar commands work for zipballs, and of course the version numbers may need adjustment)
   <li> Acquire the sources through Git using
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/oce.git
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/ocedata.git
{% endhighlight %}
    and then build them as described in #1.
    <li> Download and build using install_github()
{% highlight R %}
library(devtools)
install_github("oce", "dankelley", "develop")
install_github("ocedata", "dankelley", "master")
{% endhighlight %}
</ol>

<p>Some Windows users find it hard to install from source, so they may visit <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/awlz31v1jj7w0ct/620Tf2ZkGz">dropbox.com</a> to get binary (zip) files.  Since these files tend to be somewhat out of date, the best plan is to get set up to build packages.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce">github site</a> can be used in many ways, the most common one being to <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/issues">report a bug or request
    a feature</a>.  It is helpful if issues contain (a) test code that demonstrates the problem but does very little else, (b) a statement of the expected result, (c) a statement of the actual result, (d) the output from the R command <code>sessionInfo()</code>, and, if relevant, (e) a sample file (perhaps emailed directly to the developer).</p>
