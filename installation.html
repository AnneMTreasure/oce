<p>The stable version of oce is provided on the R archives.  It is installed
from within R with</p>
{% highlight R %}
install.packages("gsw")
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Users who are set up to build packages (which requires a C compiler, etc) may stay at the cutting edge by installing a development version.  This may be done in several ways, of which the third is probably the best for most users.</p>
<ol>
    <li> Download the source for oce and ocedata as tarballs
    (<a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/tarball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/tarball/master">ocedata</a>),
    expand the files, rename the resultant directories to <code>oce</code>
    and <code>ocedata</code> and then execute the OS commands stated below.
{% highlight bash %}
R CMD build oce
R CMD install oce_0.9-15.tar.gz # adjust version as needed
R CMD build ocedata
R CMD install ocedata_0.1.1.gz  # adjust version as needed
{% endhighlight %}
A similar procedure works for the zip files at 
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/oce/zipball/develop">oce</a>
    and
    <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/ocedata/zipball/master">ocedata</a>.
   <li> Acquire the sources through Git using
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/oce.git
git clone https://dankelley@github.com/dankelley/ocedata.git
{% endhighlight %}
    and then build them as described in #1.
    <li> Download and build using <code>install_github()</code>
{% highlight R %}
library(devtools)
install_github("oce", "dankelley", "develop")
install_github("ocedata", "dankelley", "master")
{% endhighlight %}
</ol>

<p>Some Windows users find it hard to install from source, so they may visit <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/awlz31v1jj7w0ct/620Tf2ZkGz">dropbox.com</a> to get binary (zip) files.  Since these files tend to be somewhat out of date, the best plan is to get set up to build packages.</p>
