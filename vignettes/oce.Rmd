**Abstract.** The `oce` package makes it easy to read, summarize and plot data
from a variety of Oceanographic instruments, isolating the researcher from the
quirky data formats that are common in this field. It also provides functions
for working with basic seawater properties such as the equation of state, and
with derived quantities such as the buoyancy frequency.  Although simple enough
to be used in a teaching context, `oce` is powerful enough for a research
setting.  These things are illustrated here, in the context of some practical
examples.  Worked examples are provided, in order to help readers take early
steps towards using the `oce` package in their research.

## 1. Introduction

Oceanographers must deal with measurements made by a wide variety of
instruments, a task that is complicated by the delight instrument manufacturers
seem to take in inventing new data formats. The manufacturers often provide
software for scanning the data files and producing some standard plots, but this
software is of limited use to researchers who work with several instrument types
at the same time, and who need to carry the analysis beyond the first steps,
e.g. moving beyond engineering plots to scientific plots and to statistical
analysis.

![**Figure 1.** Basic layout of a CTD object.  All `oce` objects contain slots named `data`, `metadata`, and `processingLog`, with the contents depending on the type of data.](ctd-object.png)

The need to scan diverse data files was one motivation for the creation of
`oce`, but an equal goal was to make it easy to work with the data once they
are in the system.  This was accomplished partly by the provision of functions
to work with the data, and partly by developing a uniform object design that
lets users reach inside without guesswork.

At the core of the `oce` design process is a policy of adding features
according to the priorities of practical research. As a result, `oce` is a
fairly comfortable tool today, and it should remain so as it grows.


## 2. Object design

As illustrated in Figure 1, each `oce` object contains three slots: (a) `{data`,
a list or a data frame containing the actual data (e.g., for a CTD object, this
will contain pressure, temperature, etc.), (b) `{metadata`, a list containing
data such things as file headers, the location of a CTD cast, etc., and (c)
`processingLog`, a list that documents how the file was created (often by a
`read()` or `as.X()` method) and how it was changed thereafter (e.g. by
decimating a CTD cast).

The uniformity of the various `oce` objects makes it easy to build skill
in examining and modifying objects.  The package provides for simple and general
processing of `oce` objects.  For example, if `x` is an `oce`
object, then the function call `plot(x)` will produce one type of plot if
`x` contains hydrographic data from a CTD, and quite another type of plot
if it contains velocity data from an ADCP.  This applies for a variety of
actions that can be undertaken on the `oce` objects, and it makes for easy
programming, e.g. for over a dozen types of oceanographic data files, the
following general code produces a summary plot:
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(oce)
d <- read.oce(filename)
plot(d)
```
where `filename` is the name of a file containing the data.

**Some notes on oce function names.**


1. The function used above to read a dataset ends in `.oce`, which is a signal
that the returned object is of class `oce`.  Depending on the file contents, `d`
will also have an additional class, e.g.  if `filename` contains CTD data, then
the object would have two classes: `oce` and `ctd`, and the second of these is
used in plotting, meaning that R will call a function named `read.ctd` for the
plot.

2. Generally, `oce` functions employ a "camel case" naming convention, in which
a function that is described by several words is named by stringing the words
together, capitalizing the second and subsequent words. For example,
`ctdAddColumn` takes a `ctd` object, and adds a column.

3. Function names begin with `oce` in cases where the most natural function
   name would otherwise be in conflict with a function in the base R system or
   a package commonly used by Oceanographers.  For example, `oce.approx` is
   used for a function that is analogous to `approx` in the `stats` package.
   The reason for not naming the function as `oceApprox` is a desire to provide
   a clear hint about the similarity of the functions. The reason for avoiding
   a naming conflict (by calling it `approx`) is to avoid the necessity of
   writing `oce::approx`, a notation that can be confusing to users.

## 3. Calculation of seawater properties

The `oce` package provides many functions for dealing with seawater properties.
Perhaps the most used is `swRho(S,T,p)`, which computes seawater density
$\rho=\rho(S, T, p)$, where $S$ is salinity,  $T$ is *in-situ* temperature in
$^\circ$C, and $p$ is seawater pressure, i.e. the excess over atmospheric
pressure, in dbar.  (This and similar functions starts with the letters `sw` to
designate that they relate to seawater properties; a future version of `oce`
may provide air properties, with functions names starting with `air`.) The
result is a number in the order of $1000$kg/m$^3$.  For many purposes,
Oceanographers prefer to use the density anomaly $\sigma=\rho-1000$kg/m$^3$,
provided with `swSigma(salinity,temperature,pressure)`, or its adiabatic cousin
$\sigma_\theta$, provided with `swSigmaTheta`.

Most of the functions use the UNESCO formulations of seawater properties, with
an argument called `eos` to get the TEOS-10 equivalent. Note that the `oce`
package uses the `gsw` package (by the same authors), which provides an
interface to the C library for TEOS-10. Users should be cautioned that the results obtained when using the `eos="gsw"` argument in the `oce` seawater functions may differ from the results obtained when using the `gsw` functions directly, due to unit conventions (e.g. the function `swCSTp(..., eos="gsw")` reports conductivity ratio for consistency with the UNESCO formulation, however the underlying `gsw` function `gsw_C_from_SP()` reports conductivity in mS/cm). 

A partial list of seawater functions is as follows:

* `swDynamicHeight` (dynamic height),
* `swN2` (buoyancy frequency),
* `swSCTp` (salinity from conductivity, temperature and pressure),
* `swSTrho` (salinity from temperature and density),
* `swTSrho` (temperature from salinity and density),
* `swTFreeze` (freezing temperature),
* `swAlpha` (thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha=-\rho_0^{-1}\partial\rho/\partial T$),
* `swBeta` (haline compression coefficient $\beta=\rho_0^{-1}\partial\rho/\partial S$),
* `swAlphaOverBeta` ($\alpha/\beta$),
* `swConductivity` (conductivity from $S$, $T$ and $p$),
* `swDepth` (depth from $p$ and latitude),
* `swLapseRate` (adiabatic lapse rate),
* `swRho` (density $\rho$ from $S$, $T$ and $p$),
* `swSigma` ($\rho-1000$\,kg/m$^3$),
* `swSigmaT` ($\sigma$ with $p$ set to zero and temperature unaltered),
* `swSigmaTheta` ($\sigma$ with $p$ set to zero and temperature altered adiabatically),
* `swSoundSpeed` (speed of sound),
*`swSpecificHeat` (specific heat),
* `swSpice` (a quantity used in double-diffusive research),
* `swTheta` (potential temperature $\theta$), and
* `swViscosity` (viscosity).

Details and examples are provided in the documentation of these functions.

It might help the reader to try some exercises. Note that answers are provided
at the end of this document.

**Exercise 1.**
a. What is the density of a seawater parcel at pressure
100 dbar, with salinity 34 PSU and temperature 10$^\circ$C?
b. What temperature would the parcel have if raised adiabatically to the surface?
c. What density would it have if raised adiabatically to the surface?
d. What density would it have if lowered about 100m, increasing the pressure to 200 dbar?
e. Draw a blank $T$-$S$ diagram with $S$ from 30 to 40 PSU and $T$ from -2 to 20$^\circ$C.



## 4. CTD data

### 4.1 Example with pre-trimmed data


To get you started with CTD data, `oce` provides a sample data set that has
been trimmed to just the downcast portion of the sampling.  (See the next
section to learn how to do this trimming.).  A summary of the contents of a
CTD object named `x` is obtained with `summary(x)`. A generic plotting function
is also provided, and the following commands produce Figure 2, illustrating
such a plot for a built-in CTD dataset. 
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 2.** An overview of a ctd dataset.", fig.width=6, fig.height=6, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=16)}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
plot(ctd)
```

The object used to hold CTD data stores not just the data, but also the raw
header sequence, and whatever other metadata has been discovered about the
dataset by `names(ctd@metadata)` etc.

Of course, you may apply any R techniques to the data in `oce` objects, e.g.
`hist(ctd[["temperature"]])` produces a histogram of temperature for the `ctd`
object.  (Note the use of a `[[` accessor function to look up the contents
within `oce` objects. This accessor prevents users from having to know where
data are stored in the object, and it also permits retrival of *computed*
quantities, in addition to items that are actually stored in the object.)  It
is always worth checking, though, to see if `oce` has already defined a
function that you may be applying, e.g. `plotTS` will produce a
temperature-salinity diagram, with isopycnals and proper units on the axes.

The package provides facilities for some common operations with oceanographic
data, such as trimming CTD profiles with `ctdTrim()`, but of course you may do
that sort of work by acting on the data directly, if necessary.  Just make sure
you realize that the metadata will not be altered if you do that.  Also, it is
a good idea to add log entries to any objects that you change, by using the
`processingLog` function. 

**Exercise 2.** Plot a profile of $\sigma_\theta$ and $N^2$, for the data in
the pycnocline.

### 4.2 Example with raw data

Practicing Oceanographers may be wondering how the CTD cast used in the
preceding section was trimmed of equilibration-phase and upcast-phase data.
Spurious data from these phases must be trimmed as a first step in processing.
For example, consider the following code.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 3.** Scanwise plot of the `ctdRaw` sample data set.  Note the spike at the start, the equilibration phase before the downcast, and the spurious freshening signal near the start of the upcast.", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
data(ctdRaw)
plotScan(ctdRaw)
```

This produces a two-panel plot (Figure 3) of the data as a time-series, revealing
not just the (useful) downcast, but also the subsequent upcast sequence.  The
x-axis in this plot is the scan number, which is a convenient index for
extraction of the downcast portion of the profile by an essentially manual
method, e.g. proceeding with a sequence of commands such as

```{r eval=FALSE}
plotScan(ctdTrim(ctdRaw, "range",
                 parameters=list(item="scan", from=140, to=250)))
plotScan(ctdTrim(ctdRaw, "range",
                 parameters=list(item="scan", from=150, to=250)))
```

This is the preferred method, which is recommended for detailed
work. However, for quick work, you may find that the automatic downcast
detection scheme works adequately, e.g.
```{r eval=FALSE}
ctdTrimmed <- ctdTrim(ctdRaw)
```

It should be noted that `ctdTrim` inserts entries into the object's log file,
so that you (or anyone else with whom you share the object) will be able to see
the details of how the trimming was done.

Once the profile has been trimmed, you may wish to use `ctd.decimate` to smooth
the data and interpolate the smoothed results to uniformly-spaced pressure
values. For example, a quick examination of a file might be done by the
following:
```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(ctdDecimate(ctdTrim(read.ctd("stn123.cnv"))))
```

### 4.3 Example with WOCE archive data

The package has a harder time scanning the headers of data files in the WOCE
archive format than it does in the Seabird format illustrated in the previous
examples. This is mainly because front-line researchers tend to work in the
Seabird format, and partly because the WOCE format is odd. For example, the
first line of a WOCE file is of the form `CTD,20060609WHPOSIODAM` (or
`BOTTLE,...`).  Scanning the item to the left of the comma is not difficult
(although there are variants to the two shown, e.g. `CTDO` sometimes occurs).
The part to the right of the comma is more difficult.  The first part is a date
(`yyyymmdd`) so that is no problem.  But then things start to get tricky.  In
the example provided, this text contains the division of the institute (WHPO),
the institute itself (SIO), and initial of the investigator (DAM). The problem
is that no dividers separate these items, and that there seem to be no
standards for the item lengths. Rather than spend a great deal of time coding
special cases (e.g. scanning to see if the string `WHOI` occurs in the header
line), the approach taken with `oce` is to ignore such issues relating to
quirky headers.  This frees up time to work on more important things, such as
plotting the data.

It is possible to access object constituents directly, e.g.  `x@data$salinity`
is the salinity stored in a CTD object named `x`, but this is not the preferred
method of access.  The better scheme is to use the *accessor functions*,
mentioned previously, partly because it looks throughout the object to find the
named quantities, e.g. `x[["salinity"]]` yields salinity (from the \verb+data+
slot of the object) and `x[["station"]]` yields the station identifier (from
the `metadata` slot).

For a real-world example, visit the website mentioned in the code provided
below, download and expand the zip file, enter the data directory and run the
code. (Caution: this link fails on some occasions.)

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(oce)
# Source: http://cchdo.ucsd.edu/data_access?ExpoCode=58JH199410
files <- system("ls *.csv", intern=TRUE)
for (i in 1:length(files)) {
    cat(files[i], "\n")
    x <- read.ctd(files[i])
    if (i == 1) {
        plotTS(x, xlim=c(31, 35.5), ylim=c(-1, 10), type="l", col="red")
    } else {
        lines(x[["salinity"]], x[["temperature"]], col="red")
    }
}
```

What you will see is an overall $T$-$S$ diagram for the entire dataset. It may take
a while, since the dataset contains over 90,000 observations. You may note that,
even though this is an official, quality-controlled dataset, it is not without
problems. The graph that is produced by this code has several spurious lines
oriented horizontally (indicating spurious salinity) and vertically (indicating
spurious temperature). One way to find such values is to put the lines
```{r eval=FALSE}
print(range(x[["temperature"]]))
print(range(x[["salinity"]]))
```
after the `read.ctd` call. One thing you'll find is that station 987
has a minimum salinity range of 0.0009 to 987. These values are clearly in
error, as are the temperatures at this spot in the file. (It is perhaps
revealing that the spurious salinity is equal to the station number.) Indeed, at
this spot in the file it can be seen that the pressure jumps from 1342 to 0, and
then starts increasing again; the file contains two profiles, or the same
profile twice. This is not the only flaw that is revealed by the graph, and by
`range` commands; a generous user would spend a week tracking down such
issues, and would then contact the data provider (or the chief scientist of the
field work) with specific suggestions for correcting the files. The point here
is to highlight how this package can be used with real-world data.

## 5. Section plots

The commands
```{r eval=FALSE}
data(section)
plot(section, which=c(1, 2, 3, 99))
```
will plot a summary diagram containing sections of
$T$, $S$, and $\sigma_\theta$, along with a chart indicating station
locations. In addition to such overview diagrams, `plot` can also create
individual plots of individual properties.


The Halifax section is supplied in a pre-gridded format, but some datasets have
different pressure levels at each station.  For such cases, the `sectionGrid`
function may be used, e.g. the following produces Figure 4. The ship doing the
sampling was travelling westward from the Mediterranean towards North America,
taking 124 stations in total; the `indices` value selects the last few stations
of the section, during which the ship heading was changed to run in a
northwesterly direction, to cross isobaths (and perhaps, the Gulf Stream) at
right angles.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 4.** Portion of the CTD section designated A03, showing the Gulf Sream region.  The square on the cruise track corresponds to zero distance on the sections.", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=12)}
library(oce)
data(section)
GS <- subset(section, 102<=stationId&stationId<=124)
GSg <- sectionGrid(GS, p=seq(0, 1600, 25))
plot(GSg, which=c(1,99), map.xlim=c(-85,-(64+13/60)))
```

**Exercise 3.** Draw a $T$-$S$ diagram for the section data, using black
symbols to the east of 30W and gray symbols to the west, thus highlighting
Mediterranean-derived waters. (Hint: use the accessor function `[[`.)

**Exercise 4.** Plot dynamic height and geostrophic velocity across the Gulf
Stream. (Hint: use the `swDynamicHeight` function.)

## 6. Maps

### 6.1 About projections

There are several ways to handle map projections in R and other systems. Oce
uses the `rgdal` package to calculate the details of map projections.  A
suite of functions for plotting maps is provided.  The first step is to use
`mapPlot` to construct the map, and after that, points can be added
with `mapPoints`, lines with `mapLines`, etc. For example,
```{r fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(coastlineWorld)
par(mar=rep(0, 4))
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=wintri", col="lightgray")
```
plots a world coastline in the Winkel Tripel projection (used by the National
Geographical Society, and so familiar to many viewers), using light gray ink
for the land (Fig. 5).  Adding the cruise track for the `oce` dataset called
`section` is a simple matter

```{r fig.keep="none"}
data(section)
lon <- section[["longitude", "byStation"]]
lat <- section[["latitude", "byStation"]]
mapLines(lon, lat, col='red', lwd=2)
```

![**Figure 5.** World coastline in Winkel Tripel projection, with a cruise track
indicated in red.](projection.png)

```{r echo=FALSE}
data(coastlineWorld)
par(mar=rep(1, 4))
```

Projections in `oce` are done with the `rgdal` package, and there are far too
many possibilities to illustrate here. See
[http://dankelley.github.io/r/2015/04/03/oce-proj.html](http://dankelley.github.io/r/2015/04/03/oce-proj.html)
for a blog item that provides examples of the available projections. Note that
some have a problem with spurious horizontal lines. This can result from
coastline segments that cross the edge of the plotting area, and getting rid of
this is tricky enough to be the heart of the longest-lived bug in the `oce`
issue list.

It should be noted that `oce` has a suite of tools for mapmaking. One must use
`mapPlot()` to set up a map, after which points can be added with
`mapPoints()`, lines with `mapLines()`, images with `mapImage()`, contours with
`mapContours()`, and text with `mapText()`. It is mandatory to use these
functions, instead of e.g. `points()`, because the coordinate system is
"hidden".


### 6.2 Popular world-view projections

A few common projections are worth highlighting here. In addition to the Winkel
Tripel projection shown in Figure 5, it is also common to employ Mollweide,
Eckert IV or Robinson for world-wide views; these are achieved as follows.
(The results are not shown, to lower the size of this vignette in accordance
with CRAN policies.)

```{r fig.keep="none"}
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=moll") # Molleweide
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=eck4") # Eckert IV
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=robin") # Robinson
```

Before moving on to other projections, it may be helpful to show how to plot sea surface
temperature in this projection.

```{r fig.cap="**Figure 6.** World SST in Mollweide projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=2.7, dpi=72}
par(mar=rep(1, 4))
data(levitus, package='ocedata')
lon <- levitus$longitude
lat <- levitus$latitude
SST <- levitus$SST
Tlim <- c(-2, 30)
drawPalette(Tlim, col=oce.colorsJet)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=moll", grid=FALSE)
mapImage(lon, lat, SST, col=oce.colorsJet, zlim=Tlim)
mapPolygon(coastlineWorld, col='gray')
```

### 6.3 Popular mid-latitude projections

Mid-latitude regions are sometimes represented with Lambert Conformal Conic projection,
e.g. Figure 7 was produced as follows.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 7.** North Atlantic in Lambert Conformal Conic projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=3, dpi=72}
par(mar=c(2, 2, 1, 1))
lonlim <- c(-80, 0)
latlim <- c(20, 60)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=lcc +lat_1=30 +lat_2=50 +lon_0=-40",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
```

Other common mid-latitude projections include Mercator and Albers Equal-Area Conic, produced
as follows (results not shown).
```{r , fig.keep="none"}
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=merc",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=aea +lat_1=30 +lat_2=70 +lon_0=-40",
        longitudelim=lonlim, latitudelim=latlim)
```

### 6.4 Popular high-latitude projections

High-latitude regions are often represented with stereopolar projections, e.g.
Figure 5g was produces with the following.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 8.** Arctic coastlines in stereopolar projection.", fig.width=5, fig.height=5, dpi=72}
par(mar=c(2, 2, 1, 1))
mapPlot(coastlineWorld, projection="+proj=stere +lat_0=90",
        longitudelim=c(-80,0), latitudelim=c(70, 110))
```



## 7. Sea-level data

### 7.1 Time-domain analysis

The following code loads and graphs a build-in dataset of sea-level timeseries.
The result, shown in Figure 9. The top panel is a timeseries view that provides
an overview of the entire data set. The second panel is narrowed to the most
recent month, which should reveal spring-neap cycles if the tide is mixed. The
third panel is a spectrum, with a few tidal constituents indicated. At the
bottom is a cumulative spectrum, which makes these narrow-banded constituents
quite visible.


```{r fig.cap="**Figure 9.** Sea-level timeseries measured in 2003 in Halifax Harbour.  (The spike in September is the storm surge associated with Hurricane Juan, regarded by the Canadian Hurricane Centre to be one of the most powerful and damaging hurricanes to ever hit Canada.)", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, dpi=72, dev.args=list(pointsize=16)}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
plot(sealevel)
```

**Exercise 5.** Illustrate Halifax sealevel variations during Hurricane Juan.

**Exercise 6.** Draw a spectrum of sea-level variation, with the M2 tidal component indicated.

### 7.2 Tidal-harmonic analysis

A preliminary version of tidal analysis is provided by the `tidem` function
provided in this version of the package, but readers are cautioned that the
results are certain to change in a future version.  (The problems involve
phase, and the inference of satellite nodes.)

**Exercise 7.** Plot the detided Halifax sea level during Autumn 2003, to see
whether Hurricane Juan is visibible. (Hint: use `predict` with the results from
`tidem`.)

## 8. Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler data

The following commands produce Figure 7, showing currents made in the St
Lawrence Estuary Internal Wave Experiment.
```{r fig.cap="**Figure 10.** Measurements made with an ADP in the St Lawrence Estuary.  The data were recorded in beam format, so a two-step process is used to convert to enu coordinates.  The black curve indicates the water surface, inferred from the pressure measured by the ADP.", fig.width=5, fig.height=2, dpi=72}
library(oce)
data(adp)
plot(adp, which=1, adorn=expression({lines(x[["time"]], x[["pressure"]])}))
```

## 9. Working in non-English languages

Many of the `oce` plotting functions produce axis labels that can be
displayed in languages other than English.  At the time of writing, French,
German, Spanish, and Mandarin are supported in at least a rudimentary way.
Setting the language can be done at the general system level, or within R, 
as indicated below (results not shown).
```{r fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE="fr")
data(ctd)
plot(ctd)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE="en")
```

Most of the translated items were found by online dictionaries, and so they may
be incorrect for oceanographic usage.  Readers can help out in the translation
effort, if they have knowledge of how nautical words such as *Pitch* and *Roll*
and technical terms such as *Absolute Salinity* and *Potential Temperature*
should be written in various languages.

## 10. The future of oce

The present version of `oce` can only handle data types that the author has
been using lately in his research. New data types will be added as the need
arises in that work, but the author would also be happy to add other data types
that are likely to prove useful to the Oceanographic community.  (The data types
need not be restricted to Physical Oceanography, but the author will need some
help in dealing with other types of data, given his research focus.) 

Two principles will guide the addition of data types and functions: (a) the
need, as perceived by the author or by other contributors and (b) the ease with
which the additions can be made.  One might call this development-by-triage, by
analogy to the scheme used in Emergency Rooms to organize medical effort
efficiently.

## 11. Development website

The site [http://github.com/dankelley/oce](http://github.com/dankelley/oce)
provides a window on the development that goes on between the CRAN releases of
the package. Please visit the site to report bugs, to suggest new features, or
just to see how `oce` development is coming along.  Note that the `development`
branch is used by the author in his work, and is updated so frequently that it
must be considered unstable, at least in those spots being changed on a given
day.  Every week or so, as the `development` branch stabilizes, the changes are
merged back into the `master` branch.  Official CRAN releases derive from the
`master` branch, and are done when the code is considered to be of reasonable
stability and quality.  This is all in a common pattern for open-source
software.

## 12. Answers to exercises

**Exercise 1.** Seawater properties.
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
swRho(34, 10, 100)
swTheta(34, 10, 100)
swRho(34, swTheta(34, 10, 100), 0)
swRho(34, swTheta(34, 10, 100, 200), 200)
plotTS(as.ctd(c(30,40),c(-2,20),rep(0,2)), grid=TRUE, col="white")
```


**Exercise 2.** Profile plots

Although one may argue as to the limits of the pycnocline, for illustration let
us say it is in 5 dbar to 12 dbar range.  One way to do this is

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
pycnocline <- ctdTrim(ctd, "range",
                      parameters=list(item="pressure", from=5, to=12))
plotProfile(pycnocline, which="density+N2")
```

Another is
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(ctd)
pycnocline <- subset(ctd, 5<=pressure & pressure<=12)
plotProfile(pycnocline, which="density+N2")
```

**Exercise 3.** Draw a $T$-$S$ diagram for the section data, using black
symbols to the east of 30W and gray symbols to the west, thus highlighting
Mediterranean-derived waters. (Hint: use the accessor function `[[`.)

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(section)
ctd <- as.ctd(section[["salinity"]], section[["temperature"]], section[["pressure"]])
col <- ifelse(section[['longitude']] > -30, "black", "gray")
plotTS(ctd, col=col)
```

**Exercise 4.** Plot dynamic height and geostrophic velocity across the Gulf
Stream. (Hint: use the `swDynamicHeight` function.)

(Try `?swDynamicHeight` for hints on smoothing.)
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
GS <- subset(section, 102<=stationId&stationId<=124)
dh <- swDynamicHeight(GS)
par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(3, 3, 1, 1), mgp=c(2, 0.7, 0))
plot(dh$distance, dh$height, type="l", xlab="", ylab="Dyn. Height [m]")
grid()
# 1e3 metres per kilometre
f <- coriolis(GS@data$station[[1]]@metadata$latitude)
g <- gravity(GS@data$station[[1]]@metadata$latitude)
v <- diff(dh$height)/diff(dh$distance) * g / f / 1e3
plot(dh$distance[-1], v, type="l", col="blue", xlab="Distance [km]", ylab="Velocity [m/s]")
grid()
abline(h=0)
```

**Exercise 5.** Halifax sealevel during Hurricane Juan

A web search will tell you that Hurricane Juan hit about midnight, 2003-sep-28.
The author can verify that the strongest winds occurred a bit after midnight --
that was the time he moved to a room without windows, in fear of flying glass.
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=3, fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
# Focus on 2003-Sep-28 to 29th, the time when Hurricane Juan caused flooding
plot(sealevel,which=1,xlim=as.POSIXct(c("2003-09-24","2003-10-05"), tz="UTC"))
abline(v=as.POSIXct("2003-09-29 04:00:00", tz="UTC"), col="red")
mtext("Juan", at=as.POSIXct("2003-09-29 04:00:00", tz="UTC"), col="red")
```

**Exercise 6.** Sealevel spectrum

The first step is to load the data.
```{r}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
```
Next, we extract the elevation data
```{r}
elevation <- sealevel[["elevation"]]
```
and then we return to standard R processing, to compute the spectrum, and 
indicate the M2 tide (plot not shown here).
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, results="hide", fig.keep="none"}
spectrum(elevation, spans=c(3,7))
abline(v=1/12.42)
mtext("M2",at=1/12.42,side=3)
```


**Exercise 7.** Plot the detided Halifax sea level during Autumn 2003, to see
whether Hurricane Juan is visibible. (Hint: use `predict` with the results from
`tidem`.)

```{r results="hide", fig.keep="none"}
library(oce)
data(sealevel)
m <- tidem(sealevel)
oce.plot.ts(sealevel[['time']], sealevel[['elevation']] - predict(m),
            ylab="Detided sealevel [m]", 
            xlim=c(as.POSIXct("2003-09-20"), as.POSIXct("2003-10-08")))
```

The spike reveals a surge of about 1.5m, on the 29th of September, 2003.
